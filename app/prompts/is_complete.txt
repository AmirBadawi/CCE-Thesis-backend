Given a question, your task is to determine whether the question is complete or incomplete.
A complete question is one that contains enough information to be answered without requiring additional context.
For example, ‘Who won the Fifa World Cup?’ is a complete question because it specifies everything in the sentence.
An incomplete question, on the other hand, lacks sufficient information to be answered without further clarification.
For example, ‘Who ate it?’ is an incomplete question because it does not specify the object being eaten. 
Please classify the following question as either ‘complete’ or ‘incomplete’ only.
